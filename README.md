# AHB to APB Bridge
The AHB to APB bridge is an AHB slave, providing an interface between the high- speed AHB and the low-power APB
It is required to bridge the communication gap between low bandwidth peripherals on APB with the high bandwidth ARM Processors and/or other high-speed devices on AHB. This ensures that there is no data loss between AHB to APB or APB to AHB data transfers.
